Steps for setup
1. Import the database.txt file into phpmyadmin for database setup. Do change the database connection setup according to your WAMP installation i.e password etc

2. Copy this folder (RedTie) to your websites i.e into www folder of WAMP etc

3. Run WAMP

4. Open Web browser and type localhost

5. Admin user name is "admin" and password is also "admin"

At the moment design is almost complete. I use/modify the free design taken from http://www.oswd.org/

Programming side is not fully functional except for admin login page which is working i.e admin can login and logout but yet admin options are not working.

Admin will create tutor, supervisor and student.

Tutor will assign project to student and supervisor.

Student will upload documents which can be seen by his supervisor and tutor.
